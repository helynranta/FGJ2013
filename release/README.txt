http://www.pygame.org
pygame only works with 32-bit version of python (?)

ex. python game.py runs the game
OR maybe run with IDLE: open game.py with IDLE and press F5

OR download portable python from:
http://portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython2.7.3.2

unpack it where you want, open IDLE-Portable and open scr/game.py with it.
